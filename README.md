# RestaurentSample


CASE STUDY : Design and implement a table booking app in Swift, to be used at the restaurant. Following are the key features the app should have: 

1. As a receptionist, I should be able to enter a customer in the waiting queue. (Example: Enter name and contact number)



2. As a receptionist, I should be able to allocate a table to the first person in the queue, whenever a table is free. The list should show people who are currently seated. so when receptionist taps on it, it will prompt to remove them from the table
As a receptionist, I should be able to check a customer's waiting number in the waiting list. (Example: "You are 3rd in the queue‚Äù) 




Use UserDefaults or CoreData to store the current status of the system including total number of tables in the restaurant, number of occupied tables, number of people currently in the queue, etc. 
Attached is a sample UI, you are free to create your own.
